# Chef Prime

This website was created from an idea I had while I was a private chef in the Algarve, Portugal. Our main service was to cater for families who were going on vacation in the region and wanted a private chef service in their homes.

The website will be aimed at people interested in having a premium service, such as having their own professional chef cook for them.

## Design and User Experience

### Design

The design of the website is minimalist, to allow the content to show up.

Fonts:

- Poiret one - This is the brand font, so it's used for the Logo, the Wines names and the tasting expeciences names.
- Montserrat (sans serif) - Used for the headings, the menu and the footer.
- Cormorant Garamond (serif) - As serif font is used for the smaller text (paragraphh content), it's more readable.

Colours:

## Layout

There are three pages: Home page, Gallery and Contact.
In each page we have a responsive navbar on top and a footer with social media links and a coopyright section.

### Navbar and footer

Both navbar and footer change layout depending on the size of the screen.

- __Navigation bar__

  - All the navigation items are visible on larger screen (769px and up), while they are hidden in a colapsing navbar on smaller screens (768px and down).

  - The colapsing navbar has an hamburger menu icon when it's closed, and an x symbol when it's open.
