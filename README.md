# Chef Prime

This website was created from an idea I had while I was a private chef in the Algarve, Portugal. Our main service was to cater for families who were going on vacation in the region and wanted a private chef service in their homes.

The website will be aimed at people interested in having a premium service, such as having their own professional chef cook for them.

## Design and User Experience

### Design

The design of the website is minimalist, to allow the content to show up.

Fonts:

- Poiret one - This is the brand font, so it's used for the Logo, the Wines names and the tasting expeciences names.
- Montserrat (sans serif) - Used for the headings, the menu and the footer.
- Cormorant Garamond (serif) - As serif font is used for the smaller text (paragraphh content), it's more readable.

Colours:
